1. **Agile Manifesto:**
   - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
   - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
   - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
   - **Responding to change** over following a plan.

2. **12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto:**

   - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
   - Deliver working software frequently.
   - Business people and developers must work together daily.

   - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
   - Agile processes promote sustainable development.
   - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
   - Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
   - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
   - Regularly reflect on how to become more effective, then tune and adjust behavior accordingly.

#### Agile Frameworks and Methodologies

1. **Scrum:**
   - **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.

   - Dynamic and constantly evolving.

2. **Sprint Backlog:**
   - The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

3. **Increment:**
   - The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

4. **User Stories:**
   - A short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability.

#### Agile Events

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - Determines what can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint.
   - Decides how the work needed to deliver the Increment will be achieved.

2. **Daily Scrum:**
   - A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

3. **Sprint Review:**
   - Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

3. **Lead Time and Cycle Time:**
   - Lead Time: The total time from order to delivery.
   - Cycle Time: The time it takes to complete a task.

#### Best Practices

1. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository.
   - Each integration is verified by an automated build and tests.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Write a test before writing the code that fulfills that test.
   - Ensure code coverage and early bug detection.

3. **Pair Programming:**
   - Two developers work together at one workstation.
   - Promotes better code quality and knowledge sharing.

4. **Refactoring:**
   - Improving the structure of existing code without changing its external behavior.

By understanding and applying these principles, roles, events, and practices, you will be well-prepared for an Agile assessment.
