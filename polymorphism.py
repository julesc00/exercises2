"""
Polymorphism defines the ability to take different forms. Polymorphism in Python allows us to define methods in
the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class. In this article, we will get into the
details of Polymorphism in Python in the following sequence:

Polymorphism in Python
A child class inherits all the methods from the parent class. However, in some situations, the method
inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit into the child class. In such cases, you will have
to re-implement method in the child class.
